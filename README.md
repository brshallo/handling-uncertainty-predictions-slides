.pdf of slides for UseR! 2022 elevator pitch on "Handling Uncertainty in Predictions, Approaches to Building Prediction Intervals Within a tidymodels Framework"

The .pptx of the slides (including a rough script in the notes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QNvx_n4_lPe4kfK4IsrkCKFDqoIgQmxp/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104437923524095184714&rtpof=true&sd=true).)

The pitch was primarily a set-up for my series of posts from last year on building prediction intervals in the tidymodels ecosystem, which can be found at my blog.
